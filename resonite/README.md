# Resonite

> [!Important]
> This guide is tailored more towards newcomers to Resonite, if you are already experienced with the game the more avatar-specific parts are [General Info](#general-info), [Gesture control](#gesture-control) and [Clothing and Add-ons](#clothing-and-add-ons).
> If you are new to Resonite, it is recommended to read the whole guide to also get started with some of the basics.
>
> Keep in mind, that the Resonite-Port - including the Addons - are community driven. If you run into bug or inconsistencies, please do not contact Sweetwater.

## General Info

- Besides the textures, all settings on the Installer can be changed in the [Context Menu](#context-menu) down the line.

## Context Menu

The avatar settings can be pressing "Avatar" in the context-menu. All options are saved on the avatar, so make sure to save it to your inventory after adjusting to your needs.

<!-- div:right-panel -->
To change number values you click and drag in a circular motion to not accidentally close the context menu.

<!-- div:title-panel -->
## Gesture control

<!-- div:left-panel -->
Make sure to enable it in the context-menu to use them.

### VR

In VR these are mapped to your controller. Since every controller has a different layout, we won't go into detail for all of them, but you can use the gesture-tester provided here:

### Desktop

<!-- div:left-panel -->
Unlike in VRChat, the function-keys (<kbd>F1</kbd>-<kbd>F12</kbd>) are already used by the game. Instead, you need to use <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⇧</kbd> and the Number block.

Left and right <kbd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⇧</kbd> do different face gestures and can be combined.

## Texture Emissions

Emissions are used to express yourself even more or make your textures bob to the music.
The color source and the intensity might not work, if set to "World" and the world is not supporting it.#

## Clothing and Add-ons

To keep the avatar lightweight, it doesn't come with any clothing pre-added. Instead, we offer all clothing parts and avatar add-ons as separate "orbs". You can equip these orbs through the context menu, while holding it.

### Vore Addon

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Info**

> [!Note]
> This can only be used with the "Swaggon-Internal" Avatar!
>
> The Vore system is considered 18+ Please confirm your age above by switching to second tab tab.

### **I'm over the age of 18.**

#### General

The System that is being used here is called the Expandable Vore System (EVS) together with a custom orb. We chose to use it over a custom system in order to benefit from compliance, security and feature updates as well as compatibility for existing systems in Resonite.

#### Features

- With EVS
  - Custom Swaggon belly support
  - Swallow animation
- Without EVS
  - Blendshapes Animations
  - Internal color adjustments

<!-- panels:start -->
<!-- div:title-panel -->
#### How to install

<!-- div:left-panel -->
1. Spawn out the Orb from the Respack
2. Save the folder attached to the platform to your Inventory
3. Install the "Swaggon Vore Addon" as described in a previous step
4. Adjust your internal, fluid and band color from the addons-menu
5. Save your modified avatar
6. Equip the EVS-Band of your choice from the folder you saved in step 2
   1. Keep in mind that the EVS-Band can only be spawned in hidden/private sessions

:arrow_right: When using it again, you only need to equip your avatar and repeat step 6.

> [!Important]
>
> - Best practice is to have a separate copy for 18+ shenanigans.
> - Do not save the avatar with the EVS-Band equipped. This makes your avatar heavy!
>   - The Vore-Addon-Orb can stay.
> - Do not use the EVS Installer. This will partially break the orb.
